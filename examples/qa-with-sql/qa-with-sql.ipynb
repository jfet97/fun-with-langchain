    "The approach for structured data is often for the LLM to write and execute queries in a DSL, such as SQL. In this guide we'll go over the basic ways to create a Q&A system over tabular data in databases. We will cover implementations using both chains and agents. These systems will allow us to ask a question about the data in a database and get back a natural language answer. The main difference between the two is that our agent can query the database in a loop as many times as it needs to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building Q&A systems of SQL databases requires executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high-level, the steps of these systems are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert question to DSL query: Model converts user input to a SQL query.\n",
    "1. Execute SQL query: Execute the query.\n",
    "1. Answer the question: Model responds to user input using the query results."
